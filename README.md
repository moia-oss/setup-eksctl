# Setup Eksctl

***Install a specific eksctl binary version on your Github Actions runner***

You may use this action in your github action workflow to define which version of eksctl will be used. `version` is a semantic version string like `0.57.0`. You can also use the keyword `latest` (default) to use the latest stable release of `eksctl`. Releases of `eksctl` are listed [here](https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl/releases).

```
- uses: moia-oss/setup-eksctl@v1
  with:
    version: '<version>' # default is latest
  id: install
```

Please refer to the metadata file for details about all the inputs. The cached `eksctl` binary path is prepended to the PATH environment variable and can be executed directly in further workflow steps. It is also stored in the eksctl-path output variable.

# Releasing

Tags are released automatically by a Github Action.

So in order to release just create a tag like this:
```
git tag 0.[n] -m "your message"
# This will only work if your tag includes a message
git push --follow-tags
```

or use the GitHub UI to create a tag. The `deploy.yaml` workflow force pushes to the major version tag (ex: v1.0.0 -> v1)
